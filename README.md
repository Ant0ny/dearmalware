#The site scanner of Malicious dangerous php code - DearMalWare

This is anti-malware, anti-viruses php site scanner.

It cannot fight against viruses and cannot kill them, but it's looking them in .php, .inc and .phtml files (and even in image files, if enabled):
1) potentially dangerous php functions (alarm level - high, the main is eval() php function).
If they are found it may mean that the current file is hacker admin panel/shell, or may file may be modiefied by a hacker.
2) using GET- and POST- params of HTTP requests in code (alarm level - low).
If they are found it's dangerous only potenentially. 'Cause such params use not by only a hacker, but and ordinary programmers in their every day programming.
